<p>In 1952, the Boston Symphony was almost entirely male. While it was impossible to prove that gender-biased hiring was to blame, the judges decided to host auditions with musicians playing anonymously behind large screens in the hopes it would promote diversity.
<br /><br />
To their surprise, this new supposedly-merit-based process led to results skewed even further in favor of male applicants than standard auditions.
<br /><br />
After much deliberation, applicants were asked to remove their shoes.
<br /><br />
The administrators realized that while subtle, the sound of a woman’s high heels on the stage was sufficient for gender bias to take effect.
<br /><br />
When the applicants auditioned barefoot, almost 50% of the women made it past the first round.
<br /><br />
In 1970, the percentage of female musicians in orchestras was less than 5%; today it’s around 25%.</p>

<p>Your unconscious biases aren’t your fault; they are part of human DNA, and no amount of training can make them go away. Good intentions aren&rsquo;t good enough.
<br /><br />
That’s why we invented BlindHire.
<br /><br />
BlindHire combats unconscious bias by removing the information that causes it. By redacting specific data from job applications, BlindHire lets you see the candidate for who they are, not for what they look like, and allow you to make more informed decisions about who you hire and why.
<br /><br />
When it comes to hiring: the less you see, the more you know.</p>

<h2 id="culture-fit-is-costly">Culture fit is costly.</h2>

<p>Unconscious bias in the hiring process lies at the intersection of business and civil rights. We know it’s wrong to discriminate, and now we know it’s costly. Diverse teams are proven to be more effective at problem solving than their homogeneous counterparts; good values add value.</p>

<h2 id="seamless-integration">Seamless integration.</h2>

<p>Hiring is personal. That’s why our software is built to accommodate any system. We don’t change the way you hire, we enhance it.
<br /><br />
Whether you want to dip a toe in the water, or jump in head first, we provide a range of options with varying degrees of bias-protection. Together, we evaluate your needs and find the optimal solution for your business.
<br /><br />
If you want to level the playing field, we want to help.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-numbers">More than just numbers.</h2>

<p>Numbers are tricky, and we know they need to be handled with care. As an essential tool for evaluating progress, we use our data to analyze hiring trends across every industry. When we learn, you profit.</p>

<h2 id="conscious-solutions-for-an-unconscious-problem">Conscious solutions for an unconscious problem.</h2>

<p>The first step to compensating for bias, is recognizing it exists.
<br /><br />
As unconscious biases are unconscious, they’re inherently difficult to identify and isolate. That makes correcting for them a difficult task. Where conscious discrimination is cataclysmic, unconscious bias is insidious.
<br /><br />
You can take our word for it, or you can take Harvard University’s <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">unconscious bias test</a>.
<br /><br />
Your results might surprise you.</p>
